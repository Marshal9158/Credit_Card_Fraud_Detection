# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Nowadays consumers and companies have benefited from the speed and convenience that online credit card and UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions have offered. But there has also been a notable rise in financial fraud as a result of this digital revolution. In addition to resulting in financial losses, fraudulent activity damages financial organizations' reputations and undermines customer trust. Conventional rule-based fraud detection systems are inadequate in contemporary situations because they frequently find it difficult to keep up with the changing patterns of fraud. This emphasizes the need for automated, intelligent, and flexible solutions, which is where machine learning (ML) comes into play. This project employs supervised machine learning methods including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression to detect credit card and UPI frauds. Historical transaction records with details like the transaction amount, time, location, and more make up the main dataset. Data balancing approaches like SMOTE are used to improve model performance since fraud detection datasets are extremely uneven, with a considerably greater number of legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones. 

This project's primary goal is to create a trustworthy fraud detection system that can identify questionable transactions in real-time or almost real-time, lowering financial risk and enhancing the security of online payment systems. The technologies employed in this project are particularly important in today's financial ecosystem since they provide efficiency and scalability as well as flexibility to accommodate new forms of fraud.
